PLAN for sophomore STEP applications in late summer 2022.

What to Study:

- Binary Trees! Make binary trees your BFFs. Know the difference between prefix vs postfix vs infix traversal and be able to code them up in your sleep.
- DFS vs BFS. Know which one(s) to use in any given situation. Be able to code them up in your sleep.
- Stacks vs Queues. (Very strongly related to DFS/BFS.) Know which one(s) to use in any given situation. Be able to code them up in your sleep.
- Arrays vs Linked Lists. Know the strenghs and weaknesses of each. Be able to implement either.
- Bonus: Heaps. Heaps are magic and can do damn near anything.
- Sorting. Have a working familiarity with different ways to sort. Quicksort vs Mergesort vs Bubblesort at minimum.
-Bucketsort can also be situationally awesome. Heapsort for bonus points. There are others.
- Big-O notation. Be comfortable with it.

IMPORTANT: The above is mostly overkill. It is entirely possible that a sophomore interview question will involve nothing fancier than the kinds of problems you already saw in the 3015 labs.
But these topics are still fair game so you don't want to find yourself caught unprepared.

How to Study:

Leetcode. Run through the entire list of 2200+ problems from start to finish. Start with the "Easy" ones, then move on to "Medium".
Skip the ones you don't understand and come back to them later. Once you've solved a problem in one language,
go back and solve it again in at least one additional language. (Python and C++ would be my suggestions.)
